# Introduction to NumPy ðŸš€

This repository contains my personal notes and code exercises from my foundational study of NumPy, the core library for numerical and scientific computing in Python.

This collection serves as a hands-on library of examples and a demonstration of my practice with the essential tools for data science and machine learning.

## Topics Covered

This repository includes stand-alone Python scripts, each dedicated to a specific NumPy concept:

* **`introduction_and_multidimensional_indexing.py`**: Basics of creating NumPy arrays and accessing elements in multidimensional arrays.
* **`array_slicing.py`**: Techniques for slicing 1D and 2D arrays to select subsets of data.
* **`numpy_arithmetics.py`**: Performing fast, vectorized arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) on arrays.
* **`broadcasting_in_numpy.py`**: Understanding the rules for how NumPy performs operations on arrays of different shapes.
* **`filtering_arrays.py`**: Using boolean masks to filter arrays and select elements that meet a certain criteria.
* **`aggregate_functions.py`**: Applying basic aggregate functions like `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `mean()` to arrays.
* **`random_numbers.py`**: Generating, shuffling, and choosing random numbers and arrays using NumPy's random module.
